I want to thank JetBrains to grant me the Open Source Software license for all their products. This opportunity gives me
strength to keep on going with my studies and personal project.  
To learn more about this opportunity have a look
at [Licenses for Open Source Development - Community Support](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/opensource/).

_Thank you_
